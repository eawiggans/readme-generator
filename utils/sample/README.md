# Book Search Engine




## Description
Book lovers are always on the hunt for new books to read, but they also like to keep track of old favorites and recent reads. This book search engine allows users to search Google Books' API, view entries for books, and when logged in, save books to their own collection. It can be a wish list, a list of fond memories, books for friends--anything they like.
